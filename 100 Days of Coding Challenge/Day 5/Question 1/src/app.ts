//Question 13: Your Own Array: Think of your favorite mode of transportation, such as a motorcycle or a car, and make a list that stores several examples. Use your list to print a series of statements about these items, such as “I would like to own a Honda motorcycle.”

let favTransport: string[] = ["Koenigsegg agera", "BMW", "Audi R8"]

for (let i = 0; i < favTransport.length ; i++) {
    console.log(`I will own ${favTransport[0]} one day inshallah`)
}
